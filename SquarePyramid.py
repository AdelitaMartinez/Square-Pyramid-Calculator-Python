# Purpose: Make a program to calculate the surgace area and volume of a square pyramid
# Volume of a pyramid
# Python Version:

# Display a header explaing the program

# Get the length of the base from user

# Get the height of the pyramid from user

# Calculate the volume

# Calculate the slant height

# Calculate the area of one pyramid side

# Calculate the surface area of the four sides

# Formula: 
# volume = a**2h / 3
# slantheight = sqrt(h**2 + (a / 2)**2)
# Area of one pyramid side = slantheight * a/2
